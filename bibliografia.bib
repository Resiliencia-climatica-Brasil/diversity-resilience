	abstract = {Conservation practitioners have long recognized ecological connectivity as a global priority for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function. In the early years of conservation science, ecologists extended principles of island biogeography to assess connectivity based on source patch proximity and other metrics derived from binary maps of habitat. From 2006 to 2008, the late Brad McRae introduced circuit theory as an alternative approach to model gene flow and the dispersal or movement routes of organisms. He posited concepts and metrics from electrical circuit theory as a robust way to quantify movement across multiple possible paths in a landscape, not just a single least-cost path or corridor. Circuit theory offers many theoretical, conceptual, and practical linkages to conservation science. We reviewed 459 recent studies citing circuit theory or the open-source software Circuitscape. We focused on applications of circuit theory to the science and practice of connectivity conservation, including topics in landscape and population genetics, movement and dispersal paths of organisms, anthropogenic barriers to connectivity, fire behavior, water flow, and ecosystem services. Circuit theory is likely to have an effect on conservation science and practitioners through improved insights into landscape dynamics, animal movement, and habitat-use studies and through the development of new software tools for data analysis and visualization. The influence of circuit theory on conservation comes from the theoretical basis and elegance of the approach and the powerful collaborations and active user community that have emerged. Circuit theory provides a springboard for ecological understanding and will remain an important conservation tool for researchers and practitioners around the globe.},

	abstract = {Motivated by declines in biodiversity exacerbated by climate change, we identified a network of conservation sites designed to provide resilient habitat for species, while supporting dynamic shifts in ranges and changes in ecosystem composition. Our 12-y study involved 289 scientists in 14 study regions across the conterminous United States (CONUS), and our intent was to support local-, regional-, and national-scale conservation decisions. To ensure that the network represented all species and ecosystems, we stratified CONUS into 68 ecoregions, and, within each, we comprehensively mapped the geophysical settings associated with current ecosystem and species distributions. To identify sites most resilient to climate change, we identified the portion of each geophysical setting with the most topoclimate variability (high landscape diversity) likely to be accessible to dispersers (high local connectedness). These “resilient sites” were overlaid with conservation priority maps from 104 independent assessments to indicate current value in supporting recognized biodiversity. To identify key connectivity areas for sustaining species movement in response to climate change, we codeveloped a fine-scale representation of human modification and ran a circuit-theory-based analysis that emphasized movement potential along geographic climate gradients. Integrating areas with high values for two or more factors, we identified a representative, resilient, and connected network of biodiverse lands covering 35\% of CONUS. Because the network connects climatic gradients across 250,000 biodiversity elements and multiple resilient examples of all geophysical settings in every ecoregion, it could form the spatial foundation for targeted land protection and other conservation strategies to sustain a diverse, dynamic, and adaptive world.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Forests play a critical role in stabilizing Earth’s climate. Establishing Protected Areas (PAs) represents one approach to forest conservation, but PAs were rarely created to mitigate climate change. The global impact of PAs on the carbon cycle, through avoided emissions and/or enhanced growth, has not previously been quantified due to a lack of accurate global carbon stock maps. Here we used {\textasciitilde}412 million lidar samples from NASA’s GEDI mission to estimate a total of 19.7 +/- 1.8 Gt of additional Aboveground Biomass (AGB) associated with PA status. These higher C stocks are primarily attributed to avoided emissions, and are roughly equivalent to annual global fossil fuel emissions. The total measured PA AGB was 125.3 Gt (+/- 0.63), 26\% of all mapped terrestrial woody AGB. These results underscore the importance of conservation of high integrity1, high biomass forests for avoiding carbon emissions and preserving future sequestration.},

Here we present pastclim, an R package facilitating the access and use of paleoclimatic reconstructions.

The package contains a set of functions to quickly and easily recover the climate for time periods of interest either for the whole world or specific areas, extract data from locations scattered in space and/or time, retrieve time series from individual sites, and manage the ice or land coverage, offering a handy platform to include the climate of the past into existing or new analyses and pipelines.},

Considering it, this study aims to use a geomorphology map (Geomorphons) as an input to a physically based hydrological model (Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM)) in a mountainous headwater watershed. A sensitivity analysis of five soil parameters was evaluated for streamflow simulation in each Geomorphons feature. As infiltration and saturation excess overland flow are important mechanisms for streamflow generation in complex terrain watersheds, the model’s input soil parameters were most sensitive in the “slope”, “hollow”, and “valley” features. Thus, the simulated streamflow was compared with observed data for calibration and validation. The model performance was satisfactory and equivalent to previous simulations in the same watershed using pedological survey and moisture zone maps. Therefore, the results from this study indicate that a geomorphologically based map is applicable and representative for spatially distributing hydrological parameters in the DHSVM.},

	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide the basic information required to characterise the topographic attributes of terrain. The primary derived topographic parameters associated with DEMs are slope and aspect. Slope and aspect maps are used in a wide variety of applications. Slope and aspect can be used to calculate other significant topographic parameters such as upslope area and topographic index. The topographic index, in turn, can be used by distributed hydrological models to characterise the spatial distribution of terrain moisture. Many algorithms have been developed to calculate slope, aspect and upslope area from DEMs – specifically from gridded DEMs – but little work has gone into determining the uncertainty in these parameters, or the affect of this uncertainty in further applications. The accuracy of these parameters is dependent both on the algorithm and on the errors associated with the DEM itself. Since it is almost impossible to model all the errors associated with a given slope/aspect algorithm and since a DEM is normally only provided with a single rms error, simple error propagation is not adequate to determine the error associated with the derived topographic parameters. A more rigorous method of determining the affect of DEM errors on derived topographic parameters is with statistical analysis using Monte Carlo simulation and error realisations of the DEMs. In this research we demonstrate that the error sensitivity of slope decreases as the number of neighbours used in the algorithm increases, hence steepest neighbour algorithms, which are common in hydrology are more sensitive to DEM error than algorithms that use four or more neighbours. In contrast, the average error sensitivity of aspect to DEM error is not dependent on the algorithm used. However, while the mean variability of this sensitivity was lower for the steepest neighbour algorithms, their errors were spread over a greater variety of slopes while the eight neighbour algorithms had errors confined to flat regions. The error sensitivity of upslope area and topographic index is related to the use of steepest neighbour flow routing algorithm.},

	abstract = {Land elements have been used as basic landform descriptors in many science disciplines, including soil mapping, vegetation mapping, and landscape ecology. We describe an approach in terrain classification, with the objective of deriving a method for classifying land elements from DTMs based on their fundamental characteristics. The methodology for modelling land elements is implemented as a two-step process: first, form elements are classified based on local geometry, and second, land elements are derived by evaluating the form elements in their landscape context. Form elements are derived by fuzzy classification of slope and curvature at a specified global scale (window size). The form elements are reclassified according to their geomorphometric context using a higher scale terrain position index. The resulting land elements are evaluated with respect to their predictive value for modelling soil properties. It is shown that scaling geomorphometric properties is important for applying them to predict soil properties and to model landform units. The presented model, based on scaled geomorphometric properties and geomorphometric context, using a limited number of model parameters, is capable of modelling fundamental land elements that can be utilized in soil–landscape modelling and in other applications in land resource management.},

Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustiﬁed distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justiﬁed and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species’ range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a ﬂexible and efﬁcient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

	abstract = {This map depicts the 825 terrestrial ecoregions of the globe. Ecoregions are relatively large units of land containing distinct assemblages of natural communities and species, with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change. This comprehensive, global map provides a useful framework for conducting biogeographical or macroecological research, for identifying areas of outstanding biodiversity and conservation priority, for assessing the representation and gaps in conservation efforts worldwide, and for communicating the global distribution of natural communities on earth. We have based ecoregion delineations on hundreds of previous biogeographical studies, and refined and synthesized existing information in regional workshops over 10 years to assemble the global dataset. Ecoregions are nested within two higher-order classifications: biomes (14) and biogeographic realms (8). Together, these nested classification levels provide a framework for comparison among units and the identification of representative habitats and species assemblages. Ecoregions have increasingly been adopted by research scientists, conservation organizations, and donors as a framework for analyzing biodiversity patterns, assessing conservation priorities, and directing effort and support (Ricketts et al. 1999a; Wikramanayake et al. 2001; Ricketts et al. 1999b; Olson \& Dinerstein 1998; Groves et al. 2000; Rosenzweig et al. 2003; and Luck et al. 2003). More on the approach to ecoregion mapping, the logic and design of the framework, and previous and potential uses are discusses in Olson et al. (2001) and Ricketts et al. (1999a).},

	abstract = {Wetlands are important providers of ecosystem services and key regulators of climate change. They positively contribute to global warming through their greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively through the accumulation of organic material in histosols, particularly in peatlands. Our understanding of wetlands’ services is currently constrained by limited knowledge on their distribution, extent, volume, inter-annual flood variability, and disturbance levels. We present an expert system approach to estimate wetland and peatland areas, depths and volumes, which relies on three biophysical indices related to wetland and peat formation: 1. Long-term water supply exceeding atmospheric water demand; 2. Annually or seasonally water-logged soils; 3. A geomorphological position where water is supplied and retained.
  
  The dataset is version 2 with significant improvements compare to previous version. It shows distribution of wetland, peatland and peat depth that covers the tropics and sub tropics (40° N to 60° S; 180° E to -180° W), excluding small islands. It was mapped in 231 meters spatial resolution. The dataset can be viewed in this interactive map: http://www.cifor.org/global-wetlands/.},

	abstract = {Conservationists need methods to conserve biological diversity while allowing species and communities to rearrange in response to a changing climate. We developed and tested such a method for northeastern North America that we based on physical features associated with ecological diversity and site resilience to climate change. We comprehensively mapped 30 distinct geophysical settings based on geology and elevation. Within each geophysical setting, we identified sites that were both connected by natural cover and that had relatively more microclimates indicated by diverse topography and elevation gradients. We did this by scoring every 405 ha hexagon in the region for these two characteristics and selecting those that scored {\textgreater}SD 0.5 above the mean combined score for each setting. We hypothesized that these high-scoring sites had the greatest resilience to climate change, and we compared them with sites selected by The Nature Conservancy for their high-quality rare species populations and natural community occurrences. High-scoring sites captured significantly more of the biodiversity sites than expected by chance (p {\textless} 0.0001): 75\% of the 414 target species, 49\% of the 4592 target species locations, and 53\% of the 2170 target community locations. Calcareous bedrock, coarse sand, and fine silt settings scored markedly lower for estimated resilience and had low levels of permanent land protection (average 7\%). Because our method identifies—for every geophysical setting—sites that are the most likely to retain species and functions longer under a changing climate, it reveals natural strongholds for future conservation that would also capture substantial existing biodiversity and correct the bias in current secured lands.},

	abstract = {Effective broad-spectrum biodiversity conservation requires that conservation strategies simultaneously meet the needs of multiple species. However, little is known about how maintaining habitat connectivity for one species or species group may also act as an umbrella for other species. We evaluated the degree to which predicted connected habitat for each of 144 different hypothetical organisms expressing range of dispersal abilities and ecological responses to elevation, roads and land cover function as an indicators of connected habitat for the others in the U.S. Northern Rocky Mountains. We used resistant kernel modeling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each species. At relatively large dispersal abilities there was extensive overlap between connected habitat for most organisms and much of the study area is predicted to provide connected habitat for all hypothetical organisms simultaneously. In contrast, at low to medium dispersal abilities there was much less intersection of habitat connected by dispersal. We found that habitat specialists with limited dispersal ability are weak indicators of others, and likewise are weakly indicated by others. We evaluated the effectiveness of three carnivores as connectivity umbrellas for many species. All three carnivore species performed significantly worse as connectivity umbrellas than the average across the simulated species. These species are associated with high elevation forested habitats. It is the low elevation and non-forest habitats that are most at risk of habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area, suggesting that a carnivore umbrella may miss many species most at risk.},

However, most putative movement corridors and barriers have not been based on empirical data. In this study, we identify factors that inﬂuence connectivity by comparing patterns of genetic similarity among 146 black bears (Ursus americanus), sampled across a 3,000-km2 study area in northern Idaho, with 110 landscape-resistance hypotheses. Genetic similarities were based on the pairwise percentage dissimilarity among all individuals based on nine microsatellite loci (average expected heterozygosity p 0.79). Landscape-resistance hypotheses describe a range of potential relationships between movement cost and land cover, slope, elevation, roads, Euclidean distance, and a putative movement barrier. These hypotheses were divided into seven organizational models in which the inﬂuences of barriers, distance, and landscape features were statistically separated using partial Mantel tests. Only one of the competing organizational models was fully supported: patterns of genetic structure are primarily related to landscape gradients of land cover and elevation. The alternative landscape models, isolation by barriers and isolation by distance, are not supported. In this black bear population, gene ﬂow is facilitated by contiguous forest cover at middle elevations.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning tends to focus on protecting species’ ranges or landscape connectivity but seldom both—particularly in the case of diverse taxonomic assemblages and multiple planning goals. Therefore, information on potential trade-offs between maintaining landscape connectivity and achieving other conservation objectives is lacking. We developed an optimization approach to prioritize the maximal protection of species’ ranges, ecosystem types, and forest carbon stocks, while also including habitat connectivity for range-shifting species and dispersal corridors to link protected area. We applied our approach to Sabah, Malaysia, where the state government mandated an increase in protected-area coverage of approximately 305,000 ha but did not specify where new protected areas should be. Compared with a conservation planning approach that did not incorporate the 2 connectivity features, our approach increased the protection of dispersal corridors and elevational connectivity by 13\% and 21\%, respectively. Coverage of vertebrate and plant species’ ranges and forest types were the same whether connectivity was included or excluded. Our approach protected 2\% less forest carbon and 3\% less butterfly range than when connectivity features were not included. Hence, the inclusion of connectivity into conservation planning can generate large increases in the protection of landscape connectivity with minimal loss of representation of other conservation targets.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications, siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct, the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained despite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract: To conserve ecological connectivity (the ability to support animal movement, gene flow, range shifts, and other ecological and evolutionary processes that require large areas), conservation professionals need coarse-grained maps to serve as decision-support tools or vision statements and fine-grained maps to prescribe site-specific interventions. To date, research has focused primarily on fine-grained maps (linkage designs) covering small areas. In contrast, we devised 7 steps to coarsely map dozens to hundreds of linkages over a large area, such as a nation, province, or ecoregion. We provide recommendations on how to perform each step on the basis of our experiences with 6 projects: California Missing Linkages (2001), Arizona Wildlife Linkage Assessment (2006), California Essential Habitat Connectivity (2010), Two Countries, One Forest (northeastern United States and southeastern Canada) (2010), Washington State Connected Landscapes (2010), and the Bhutan Biological Corridor Complex (2010). The 2 most difficult steps are mapping natural landscape blocks (areas whose conservation value derives from the species and ecological processes within them) and determining which pairs of blocks can feasibly be connected in a way that promotes conservation. Decision rules for mapping natural landscape blocks and determining which pairs of blocks to connect must reflect not only technical criteria, but also the values and priorities of stakeholders. We recommend blocks be mapped on the basis of a combination of naturalness, protection status, linear barriers, and habitat quality for selected species. We describe manual and automated procedures to identify currently functioning or restorable linkages. Once pairs of blocks have been identified, linkage polygons can be mapped by least-cost modeling, other approaches from graph theory, or individual-based movement models. The approaches we outline make assumptions explicit, have outputs that can be improved as underlying data are improved, and help implementers focus strictly on ecological connectivity.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The establishment of ecological networks (ENs) has been proposed as an ideal way to counteract the increasing fragmentation of natural ecosystems and as a necessary complement to the establishment of protected areas for biodiversity conservation. This conservation tool, which comprises core areas, corridors, and buffer areas, has attracted the attention of several national and European institutions. It is thought that ENs can connect habitat patches and thus enable species to move across unsuitable areas. In Europe, however, ENs are proposed as an oversimplification of complex ecological concepts, and we maintain that they are of limited use for biodiversity conservation for several reasons. The ENs are species specific and operate on species-dependent scales. In addition, the information needed for their implementation is only available for a handful of species. To overcome these limitations, ENs have been proposed on a landscape scale (and for selected “focal” species), but there is no indication that the structural composition of core areas, corridors, and buffer areas could ensure the functional connectivity and improve the viability of more than a few species. The theory behind ENs fails to provide sufficient practical information on how to build them (e.g., width, shape, structure, content). In fact, no EN so far has been validated in practice (ensuring connectivity and increasing overall biodiversity conservation), and there are no signs that validation will be possible in the near future. In view of these limitations, it is difficult to justify spending economic and political resources on building systems that are at best working hypotheses that cannot be evaluated on a practical level.},

Amphibian assemblages seem to be affected by contemporary climate and dispersal-based processes. However, historical processes involved in present patterns of beta diversity remain poorly understood. We assess and disentangle geomorphological, climatic and spatial drivers of amphibian beta diversity in coastal lowlands of the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that geomorphological factors are more important in structuring anuran beta diversity than climatic and spatial factors. We obtained species composition via field survey (N = 766 individuals), museum specimens (N = 9,730) and literature records (N = 4,763). Sampling area was divided in four spatially explicit geomorphological units, representing historical predictors. Climatic descriptors were represented by the first two axis of a Principal Component Analysis. Spatial predictors in different spatial scales were described by Moran Eigenvector Maps. Redundancy Analysis was implemented to partition the explained variation of species composition by geomorphological, climatic and spatial predictors. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to test neutral theory predictions. Beta diversity was spatially structured in broader scales. Shared fraction between climatic and geomorphological variables was an important predictor of species composition (13\%), as well as broad scale spatial predictors (13\%). However, geomorphological variables alone were the most important predictor of beta diversity (42\%). Historical factors related to geomorphology must have played a crucial role in structuring amphibian beta diversity. The complex relationships between geomorphological history and climatic gradients generated by the Serra do Mar Precambrian basements were also important. We highlight the importance of combining spatially explicit historical and contemporary predictors for understanding and disentangling major drivers of beta diversity patterns.},

This reveals a hotspot within the Brazilian Atlantic forest hotspot. We show that the southern Atlantic forest was climatically unstable relative to the central region, which served as a large climatic refugium for neotropical species in the late Pleistocene.

	abstract = {Brazil has a pronounced complexity in coastal region, which affects the restingas’ diversity patterns. Therefore, we reviewed and systematized the knowledge about the attributes influencing the characterization and, eventually, the biases in the identification of restingas’ diversity patterns, mainly focusing in the Brazilian North and Northeast regions. Coastal geomorphology is one of the key attributes contributing to this complexity, acting as an environmental filter for the colonization of plant species. According to the standard classification, the Brazilian coast can be divided into five regions (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, and South). Another relevant attribute is phytophysiognomies, characterized by the collective characteristics of vegetation in a region, and for which exists six different classifications. The one proposed by Silva and Britez (2005) presents the best trade-off between specificity and generality by allowing both adequate local characterization and systematization for regional comparisons. Despite the length of the North and Northeast coast of Brazil, only 44 studies were conducted in these regions. The sampled areas were typically close to the state capitals, showing that logistical factors interfere with the selection of study areas. Besides, almost half of the studies omitted essential information such as the total area and sampling time, making it challenging to assess sample sufficiency and reproducibility. Another observed bias was a higher species richness in studies that partially or entirely used herbarium data. These gaps and biases on information constrain the ecological synthesis of restinga’ biodiversity patterns, mainly in larger spatial scales than those in which individual studies were conducted.},

	abstract = {Detection of terrain features more quickly and accurately is crucial in geosciences for the extracting and classifying landforms. Part of the local relief attributes would be lost in employing the conventional TPI (Topographic Position Index)-based methods to recognize terrain characteristics (landform recognition, extraction, and classification) due to use of the central tendency index (mean index). As a result, the automated recognition, extraction, and classification of terrain features (summit/ridge and pit/drainage) were performed in this research using the kernel pattern modeling based on digital elevation model (DEM) in the raster grid structure. Accordingly, three novel TPI-based algorithms including simple multi-level recognition system (SMRS), complex multi-level recognition system (CMRS), and central position recognition system (CPRS) were developed to recognize the terrain similarity to summit/ridgeline or terrain convex surfaces (and/or deviation from the pit/drainage or terrain concave surfaces). The algorithms were formulated and programmed using Python programming language and integrated in a software package as well. The results show that the SMRS algorithm tends to have more binary gradation (higher contrast) in smaller dimensions of the moving window, being problematic in some geovisual and cartographical applications. Output of the CPRS algorithm shows more continuity and better performance in the extraction of summit points in a vector data model format. All the three algorithms apply greater degree of generalization to the results as size of the moving window becomes larger. The accuracy assessment, sensitivity analysis, and possible sources of the errors were evaluated. Finally feature extraction and landform classification performed based on output results of the algorithms. The accuracy assessment and validation of the models were examined compared to the TPI and DEV (deviation from mean elevation) models by means of the D8 (for drainage path extraction) and inverted D8 (for ridgeline extraction) algorithms. Accordingly, all the developed algorithms perform better than the conventional method of TPI. The SMRS (88.87\%) and then CPRS (64.53\%) performed better than the other algorithms and TPI (56.83\%). The DEV performance (59.52\%) is similar to CMRS (59.19\%) and better than TPI. Based on the temporal sensitivity analysis, CMRS and SMRS are the most and least sensitive algorithms to the moving window size and spatial resolution variations, respectively. The possible error sources (edge effect, kernel local pattern, and point vectorization) were evaluated for the algorithms. Then, feature extraction (including summit/ridge or pit/drainage) was implemented on outputs of the algorithms. The CMRS and CPRS models displayed better performance in the vector point extraction compared to the other algorithms. A new landform classification system including 25 classes was also designed based on outputs of the developed algorithms combined with the terrain elevation variable. Landform classification maps generated based on the SMRS algorithm is visually different from what provided by the other algorithms and the CPRS landform classification performed better in distinguishing land units. The kernel size variations can modify landform recognition and classification scale in such a way that whatever size of the moving window is larger, the landform unit generalization is greater.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we first describe the global nature of tropical regoliths, showing the remarkable differences with temperate latitudes counterparts. It is shown that most regoliths and subsoils in the tropics are polycyclic and not directly attributable to the present-day climates because of inherited features from past climatic conditions. The Brazilian land surface has one of the deepest regolith mantles at a planetary scale, resulting from a long-term evolution under terrestrial conditions and warm, tropical climates within a tropical latitudinal belt since the Jurassic. Depending on the parent rocks, this deep regolith is varied in the constitution, but mature pre-weathered sediments are commonly observed throughout the country. The two basic subsoils (kaolinitic/bauxitic and Fe-rich ferricretes) are described, and we offer a fresh perspective on the Brazilian view of these common tropical regoliths. We present a pioneering map of the distribution of Brazilian regoliths according to depth to the lithic contact, estimated from soil surveys. It indicates that the shallowest depths are found on resistant rock belts, especially along the quartzitic Espinhaço Range and scattered areas on granites and quartzites in the southern Amazon. The main area of shallow saprolites is those on granites and migmatites/gneiss from the semiarid northeast. Thus, climate and geological structure are essential for subsoil deepening, and most of the Brazilian landmass is dominated by much deeper subsoils, reaching depths exceeding 20 m of rotten rocks. To understand the formation of regoliths in the Brazilian landmass, we present all types of tropical alterations classified according to the geochemical processes. The allitization, monosiallitization, bisiallitization, and ferrallitization are defined and exemplified in Brazil, showing their relationship with current and past climatic differences. We highlight Oxisols as the main representatives of weathered and deep saprolite-derived soils. Their chemical, physical, and mineralogical properties reflect prolonged weathering and chemical denudation, and the nature of saprolites has a definite impact on soil constituents, irrespective of bioclimatic conditions. The vast distribution of deep regoliths in the tropical domain is associated with extensive aquifers, mainly under sandy formations of the Paleo-Mesozoic basins. For a broad discussion on the chemical and physical limitations of hostile subsoils in Brazil, we used the framework of the major rocks found in the country and their association with soil-landform and regolith attributes. Finally, we believe that the importance of subsoils and regoliths, their genesis, and environmental implications must be discussed in a broader perspective, incorporating hydrological, pedological, and environmental interplays focused on practical applications of this knowledge. Therefore, we argue that regoliths and subsoils are now recognized as an essential part of the critical zone.},

In nature conservation planning, the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an excellent framework for both the private and public sectors. The north coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil is an area widely used for tourism, with critical problems related to mainly anthropogenic degradation of nature. Forty-three geosites that show important records of regional geology were analyzed for their potential support in achieving the UN 17 SDG and 169 targets. Using Essential Geodiversity Variables (EGVs), our results indicate that, from the 17 SDGs, 13 could benefit directly from actions involving local geodiversity. The relative performance of the geosites in terms of the number of targets for each SDG ranges from 7.7 to 50\%. We show that geodiversity plays a fundamental role in contributing to sustainable development and has great potential to influence public policies. In addition, our work can serve as an inspiration for studies involving ecosystem services and encourage greater participation of the local community in nature conservation actions with the sustainable use of geodiversity.},

	abstract = {This work presents a 1:10,000 geomorphological mapping of an area in southeastern Brazil, based on morphometric analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while classical methods focus on photo interpretation. Data derived from the DEM include elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, vertical and horizontal curvatures, amplitude, elongation and wavelength of landforms. These parameters were used along with slope shape and drainage patterns to classify the landforms according to the Land Systems method, in which portions of the landscape that presents similar terrains attributes are grouped from regional (low detail) to local (high detail) scales, respectively, Land Systems, Land Units and Land Elements. The São Paulo State geomorphological map at 1:1,000,000 scale is considered the best reference source, and was compared with the results obtained in this project. Two Land Systems, four Land Units and twelve Land Elements were identified in the study area. In this area, karst terrains are common and easily identified due their characteristics drainage patterns, amplitude and slope gradient. Karst terrain boundaries defined in this study do overlap with those defined in the state map, however the morphometric analysis allowed a better description of the terrain attributes used to define them. The terrain attributes derived automatically from the DEM enabled an accurate geomorphological classification of the study area. The methodology presented in this paper is considered effective for mapping landforms at a detailed scale and can be employed in regional scale mapping using coarser resolution DEMs.},

Therefore, the need to maintain connectivity for these species in human-dominated Atlantic landscapes is critical. In this study, we evaluated the landscape connectivity for large carnivores (cougar and jaguar) among the Strictly Protected Areas in the Atlantic Forest, evaluated the efficiency of the Mosaics of Protected Areas linked to land uses in promoting landscape connectivity, identified the critical habitat connections, and predicted the landscape connectivity status under the implementation of legislation for protecting riparian forests. The method was based on expert opinion translated into land use and land cover maps. The results show that the Protected Areas are still connected by a narrow band of landscape that is permeable to both species and that the Mosaics of Protected Areas increase the amount of protected area but fail to increase the connectivity between the forested mountain ranges (Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira). Riparian forests greatly increase connectivity, more than tripling the cougars’ priority areas. We note that the selection of Brazilian protected areas still fails to create connectivity among the legally protected forest remnants. We recommend the immediate protection of the priority areas identified that would increase the structural landscape connectivity for these large carnivores, especially paths in the SE/NW direction between the two mountain ranges.},

	abstract = {To ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity, conservation strategies must account for the entire range of climate change impacts. A variety of spatial prioritisation techniques have been developed to incorporate climate change. Here, we provide the first standardised review of these approaches. Using a systematic search, we analysed peer-reviewed spatial prioritisation publications (n=46) and found that the most common approaches (n=41, 89\%) utilised forecasts of species distributions and aimed to either protect future species habitats (n=24, 52\%) or identify climate refugia to shelter species from climate change (n=17, 37\%). Other approaches (n=17, 37\%) used well-established conservation planning principles to combat climate change, aimed at broadly increasing either connectivity (n=11, 24\%) or the degree of heterogeneity of abiotic factors captured in the planning process (n=8, 17\%), with some approaches combining multiple goals. We also find a strong terrestrial focus (n=35, 76\%), and heavy geographical bias towards North America (n=8, 17\%) and Australia (n=11, 24\%). While there is an increasing trend of incorporating climate change into spatial prioritisation, we found that serious gaps in current methodologies still exist. Future research must focus on developing methodologies that allow planners to incorporate human responses to climate change and recognise that discrete climate impacts (e.g. extreme events), which are increasing in frequency and severity, must be addressed within the spatial prioritisation framework. By identifying obvious gaps and highlighting future research needs this review will help practitioners better plan for conservation action in the face of multiple threats including climate change.},

	abstract = {Climate adaptation strategies are being developed and implemented to protect biodiversity from the impacts of climate change. A well-established strategy involves the identification and addition of new areas for conservation, and most countries agreed in 2010 to expand the global protected area (PA) network to 17\% by 2020 (Aichi Biodiversity Target 11). Although great efforts to expand the global PA network have been made, the potential of newly established PAs to conserve biodiversity under future climate change remains unclear at the global scale. Here, we conducted the first global-extent, country-level assessment of the contribution of PA network expansion toward three key land prioritization approaches for biodiversity persistence under climate change: protecting climate refugia, protecting abiotic diversity, and increasing connectivity. These approaches avoid uncertainties of biodiversity predictions under climate change as well as the issue of undescribed species. We found that 51\% of the countries created new PAs in locations with lower mean climate velocity (representing better climate refugia) and 58\% added PAs in areas with higher mean abiotic diversity compared to the available, non-human-dominated lands not chosen for protection. However, connectivity among PAs declined in 53\% of the countries, indicating that many new PAs were located far from existing PAs. Lastly, we identified potential improvements for climate adaptation, showing that 94\% of the countries have the opportunity to improve in executing one or more approaches to conserve biodiversity. Most countries (60\%) were associated with multiple opportunities, highlighting the need for integrative strategies that target multiple land protection approaches. Our results demonstrate that a global improvement in the protection of climate refugia, abiotic diversity, and connectivity of reserves is needed to complement land protection informed by existing and projected species distributions. Our study also provides a framework for countries to prioritize land protection for climate adaptation using publicly available data.},

	abstract = {Conservationists have proposed methods for adapting to climate change that assume species distributions are primarily explained by climate variables. The key idea is to use the understanding of species-climate relationships to map corridors and to identify regions of faunal stability or high species turnover. An alternative approach is to adopt an evolutionary timescale and ask ultimately what factors control total diversity, so that over the long run the major drivers of total species richness can be protected. Within a single climatic region, the temperate area encompassing all of the Northeastern U.S. and Maritime Canada, we hypothesized that geologic factors may take precedence over climate in explaining diversity patterns. If geophysical diversity does drive regional diversity, then conserving geophysical settings may offer an approach to conservation that protects diversity under both current and future climates. Here we tested how well geology predicts the species diversity of 14 US states and three Canadian provinces, using a comprehensive new spatial dataset. Results of linear regressions of species diversity on all possible combinations of 23 geophysical and climatic variables indicated that four geophysical factors; the number of geological classes, latitude, elevation range and the amount of calcareous bedrock, predicted species diversity with certainty (adj. R2 = 0.94). To confirm the species-geology relationships we ran an independent test using 18,700 location points for 885 rare species and found that 40\% of the species were restricted to a single geology. Moreover, each geology class supported 5–95 endemic species and chi-square tests confirmed that calcareous bedrock and extreme elevations had significantly more rare species than expected by chance (P{\textless}0.0001), strongly corroborating the regression model. Our results suggest that protecting geophysical settings will conserve the stage for current and future biodiversity and may be a robust alternative to species-level predictions.},

	abstract = {Landscape connectivity, the extent to which a landscape facilitates the flow of ecological processes such as organism movement, has grown to become a central focus of applied ecology and conservation science. Several computational algorithms have been developed to understand and map connectivity, and many studies have validated their predictions using empirical data. Yet at present, there is no published comparative analysis which uses a comprehensive simulation framework to measure the accuracy and performance of the dominant methods in connectivity modelling. Given the widespread usage of such models in spatial ecology and conservation science, a thorough evaluation of their predictive abilities using simulation techniques is essential for guiding their appropriate and effective application across different contexts. In this paper, we address this by using the individual-based movement model Pathwalker to simulate different connectivity scenarios generated from a wide range of possible movement behaviours and spatial complexities. With this simulated data, we test the predictive abilities of three major connectivity models: factorial least-cost paths, resistant kernels, and Circuitscape. Our study shows the latter two of these three models to consistently perform most accurately in nearly all cases, with their abilities varying substantially in different contexts. For the majority of conservation applications, we infer resistant kernels to be the most appropriate model, except for when the movement is strongly directed towards a known location. We conclude this paper with a review and interdisciplinary discussion of the current limitations and possible future developments of connectivity modelling.},

	abstract = {Key to understanding the implications of climate and land use change on biodiversity and natural resources is to incorporate the physiographic platform on which changes in ecological systems unfold. Here, we advance a detailed classification and high-resolution map of physiography, built by combining landforms and lithology (soil parent material) at multiple spatial scales. We used only relatively static abiotic variables (i.e., excluded climatic and biotic factors) to prevent confounding current ecological patterns and processes with enduring landscape features, and to make the physiographic classification more interpretable for climate adaptation planning. We generated novel spatial databases for 15 landform and 269 physiographic types across the conterminous United States of America. We examined their potential use by natural resource managers by placing them within a contemporary climate change adaptation framework, and found our physiographic databases could play key roles in four of seven general adaptation strategies. We also calculated correlations with common empirical measures of biodiversity to examine the degree to which the physiographic setting explains various aspects of current biodiversity patterns. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between landform diversity and measures of climate change to explore how changes may unfold across a geophysical template. We found landform types are particularly sensitive to spatial scale, and so we recommend using high-resolution datasets when possible, as well as generating metrics using multiple neighborhood sizes to both minimize and characterize potential unknown biases. We illustrate how our work can inform current strategies for climate change adaptation. The analytical framework and classification of landforms and parent material are easily extendable to other geographies and may be used to promote climate change adaptation in other settings.},

	abstract = {Global terrain classification data have been used for various issues related to topography such as the estimation of soil types and of ground vulnerability to earthquakes and the creation of seismic hazard maps. However, due to the resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs), the terrain classification data from previous studies could not discriminate small landforms such as plains at the bottom of narrow valleys and small rises in plains. Owing to the greater regional variation of small landforms, there is trade-off between DEMs of higher resolution and the creation of global geomorphological legends. To address this problem, we first merged regions with similar topographic characteristics using slope gradients and HAND (height above the nearest drainage) calculated by the 90-m-spatial-resolution DEMs interpolated from the multi-error-removed improved-terrain DEM (MERIT DEM), and united the polygons with the unit catchments of the MERIT-Basins dataset, so that the polygons contain calculated terrain measurements (slope gradient, HAND, surface texture, local convexity, sinks) and noise types as attributes, as well as the ID number of the unit catchment. In addition, we performed k-means clustering on the dataset using slope gradient, HAND, and surface texture, which can be combined with the dataset as a simple terrain classification. The clustering results were prepared in 15 and 40 global uniform clusters and 15 and 40 clusters for each basin to understand the global appearance of the terrain and provide zoning data for regional problem-solving. The 15 clusters were prepared to observe the outline of the terrain without any processing, whereas the 40 clusters were prepared to group and reclassify the polygons to create zoning data for each region. This dataset showed improvements in terms of capturing the small rises in plains compared to the authors’ previous global terrain classification data. This dataset can be used as a proxy and is expected to contribute to modeling and estimation in various applications that are known to be related to topography.

	abstract = {Understanding how landscape features affect gene flow has implications for numerous fields including molecular and evolutionary ecology. Despite this, modelling landscape resistance surfaces has remained a significant challenge. The R package resistancega was developed to provide a framework for optimizing landscape resistance surfaces. In this study, we assessed ResistanceGA's ability to recover the true resistance surface under a variety of scenarios, including when the underlying surface: (a) had different levels of spatial autocorrelation and (b) was transformed into a resistance surface using different functional transformations. These scenarios were evaluated with regard to varying sample size and varying levels of variance in the measure of genetic distance. We also assessed the ability of ResistanceGA to identify the true resistance surface among alternative correlated surfaces. In univariate simulations, correlation between the true and optimized resistance surfaces remained high with increased variance in genetic distance, but only when sample size was moderate to high (≥50). Model selection error was also driven by sample size with low type I error when simulations had moderate to high sample sizes, even with moderate to high variance in genetic distance and correlated alternative surfaces. ResistanceGA also performed well in multivariate simulationsbut had more difficulty identifying the true data generating surfaces when genetic data were simulated using an agent-based approach (especially with individual-based genetic data). Overall, our simulations highlight the ability of ResistanceGA to accurately optimize resistance surfaces but also underscore challenges in optimizing landscape resistance surfaces, especially with highly stochastic individual-based data.},

	abstract = {Increasing connectivity is an important strategy for facilitating species range shifts and maintaining biodiversity in the face of climate change. To date, however, few researchers have included future climate projections in efforts to prioritize areas for increasing connectivity. We identified key areas likely to facilitate climate-induced species’ movement across western North America. Using historical climate data sets and future climate projections, we mapped potential species’ movement routes that link current climate conditions to analogous climate conditions in the future (i.e., future climate analogs) with a novel moving-window analysis based on electrical circuit theory. In addition to tracing shifting climates, the approach accounted for landscape permeability and empirically derived species’ dispersal capabilities. We compared connectivity maps generated with our climate-change-informed approach with maps of connectivity based solely on the degree of human modification of the landscape. Including future climate projections in connectivity models substantially shifted and constrained priority areas for movement to a smaller proportion of the landscape than when climate projections were not considered. Potential movement, measured as current flow, decreased in all ecoregions when climate projections were included, particularly when dispersal was limited, which made climate analogs inaccessible. Many areas emerged as important for connectivity only when climate change was modeled in 2 time steps rather than in a single time step. Our results illustrate that movement routes needed to track changing climatic conditions may differ from those that connect present-day landscapes. Incorporating future climate projections into connectivity modeling is an important step toward facilitating successful species movement and population persistence in a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Pool-breeding amphibian populations operate at multiple scales, from the individual pool to surrounding upland habitat to clusters of pools. When metapopulation dynamics play a role in long-term viability, conservation efforts limited to the protection of individual pools or even pools with associated upland habitat may be ineffective over the long term if connectivity among pools is not maintained. Connectivity becomes especially important and difficult to assess in regions where suburban sprawl is rapidly increasing land development, road density, and traffic rates. We developed a model of connectivity among vernal pools for the four ambystomatid salamanders that occur in Massachusetts and applied it to the nearly 30,000 potential ephemeral wetlands across the state. The model was based on a modification of the kernel estimator (a density estimator commonly used in home range studies) that takes landscape resistance into account. The model was parameterized with empirical migration distances for spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), dispersal distances for marbled salamanders (A. opacum), and expert-derived estimates of landscape resistance. The model ranked vernal pools in Massachusetts by local, neighborhood, and regional connectivity and by an integrated measure of connectivity, both statewide and within ecoregions. The most functionally connected pool complexes occurred in southeastern and northeastern Massachusetts, areas with rapidly increasing suburban development. In a sensitivity analysis estimates of pool connectivity were relatively insensitive to uncertainty in parameter estimates, especially at the local and neighborhood scales. Our connectivity model could be used to prioritize conservation efforts for vernal-pool amphibian populations at broader scales than traditional pool-based approaches.},

Nonetheless, relatively little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that ultimately lead to montane diversity. In this study, we used target capture of ultraconserved elements to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and diversification patterns of Melanophryniscus (Bufonidae) and Brachycephalus (Brachycephalidae), two frog genera that occur in sky islands of the southern Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Specifically, we tested whether diversification of montane species in these genera could be explained by a single climatic shift leading to isolation in sky islands, followed by climatic stability that maintained populations in allopatry. In both genera, the topologies inferred using concatenation and coalescent-based methods were concordant and had strong nodal support, except for a few recent splits, which nevertheless tended to be supported by more informative loci. Estimation of divergence time of a combined dataset using both genera is consistent with a concordant timing of their diversification. These results support the scenario of diversification by isolation in sky islands and suggest that allopatry attributable to climatic gradients in montane regions is an important mechanism for generating species diversity and endemism in these regions.},

The main aim of this paper is present a framework to map LF considering the landscape approach. Our study case was a watershed located in the mountain region of Rio de Janeiro state. To achieve the goal, we defined landscape units and ecosystem functions. Based on it, a correlation matrix was produced and sent to experts for consultation. Then, we map the potential of landscape units to provide EF. The result showed that, of 23 landscape units, six units had relevance for habitat, information and regulation functions; five showed potential to perform production and regulation functions, one unit showed potential to perform habitat maintenance and information functions. Seven units showed relevance for only one function category. This study highlights how multifunctional a landscape can be. It was evident that different landscape components are able to provide a wild range of EF. Moreover, this represent a high capacity to propose sustainable alternatives for landscapes—knowing the landscape unit potential to provide LF it is possible to indicate the best options for its use and potentialize the LF provision. It was evident that well managed landscapes are also capable to provide LF.},

Here we examine genetic differentiation and historical distributions in the Rhinella crucifer group of toads, endemic to and widely distributed within this biome. We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial (control region, ND1, and ND2) and nuclear (β-crystallin and rhodopsin) DNA markers from 65 individuals representing five species. We found deep structure across the range at mitochondrial markers; genetic diversity is geographically structured in four main haplotype clades with the oldest divergence, dated to the Pliocene, between the southernmost populations and other regions of the species’ range. Remaining populations are distributed in haplotype clades that may have diverged throughout the Pleistocene. Our paleoecological distribution models support a scenario of habitat fragmentation associated with glacial cycling, but we found limited congruence of phylogeographic patterns with the refugia. We found that some genetic breaks geographically coincide with putative barriers associated to neotectonic activity, but finer-scale sampling will be necessary to test the relative importance of distinct isolation mechanisms. Overall, the data refute the recently proposed hypothesis of a southern Holocene colonization of the Atlantic Forest from northern refugia, suggesting instead persistence of forested habitats in the south. Our unexpected results underscore the need to consider distinct organismal histories in planning biome-level conservation. We discuss species correspondence to clades recovered in our phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil harbors outstanding species richness and levels of endemism, representing one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. Yet, a lot is still unknown about the spatial and temporal evolution of its biota. While the history of the region is complex, with taxa often showing distinct richness patterns and evolutionary histories, some trends are common to a variety of lineages. Higher species richness is often found in the topographically complex coast of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, but the variety of environmental spaces available within this domain, tied to the different niches explored by its species, also support the existence of other patterns of species accumulation. The biological communities that inhabit the southern portions of the Atlantic forest are clearly distinct from those that occupy the northern range of the domain: several taxa undergo turnover in the Doce river valley (state of Espírito Santo), while others shift further south (near the Rio de Janeiro/São Paulo state boundary), or further north (state of Bahia). Areas of endemism have been recognized within the forest; while their boundaries do not perfectly match across all taxonomic groups, a nested pattern is detected, with contiguous areas of endemism defined by low-dispersal organisms (e.g., harvestmen) often fitting within more inclusive endemism centers defined by high-dispersal groups (e.g., birds). To date, the fauna and flora has been compartmentalized into five main areas of endemism: (1) Pernambuco, (2) Coastal Bahia, (3) Central Bahia, (4) Serra do Mar (often with further subregions), and (5) Paraná/Araucaria (Fig. 16.2). Here, we summarize main spatial patterns of diversity, flagging areas of higher species accumulation, turnover, and endemism. We also review main patterns of lineage divergence and population structure recovered from molecular phylogenies and phylogeographic studies, and explore some of the most common diversification hypotheses proposed for the Atlantic forest biota to date. We demonstrate that the spatial turnover of lineages within species largely mirrors that of species within communities; both climate change and geographic barriers appear to have acted in combination to produce patterns of diversification. However, while geographic patterns of species and genetic diversity are similar across Atlantic forest organisms, their underlying processes are not.},

ENMs were constructed using the Ensemble forecasting approach and were projected into past climatic conditions for the last interglacial period (LIG, 120 kyr), last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 kyr), and the Middle Holocene (MH, 6 kyr). Our results suggest an expansion of wetter forests during the LGM into areas currently covered by the Caatinga seasonally dry woodlands, with recent retraction to the current distribution. Central AF islands located south of the São Francisco River underwent a different history compared to Northern AF islands north of this river: the former were mostly connected to coastal AF since the LIG (with a very recent separation), whereas the latter presented a more dynamic historical distribution. Results reveal contrasting spatiotemporal histories of forest instability and isolation across the various enclaves, supporting three main biogeographic hypotheses: i) moderate connectivity with coastal AF and a recent population bottleneck in the Araripe and Pernambuco/Paraíba enclaves, ii) low connectivity to, and long-term isolation from, other enclaves, as well as recent population bottleneck, in the northernmost North Ceará enclaves; and iii) high connectivity with coastal AF and recent population expansion in the southernmost Chapada Diamantina enclaves. Future comparative phylogeography studies will largely aid in assessing the herein proposed biogeographic scenarios during the highly dynamic recent history of the AF enclaves.},

We used mitochondrial sequences of the Cox1, Cox2 and Cytb genes in order to infer some aspects of the evolutionary history and phylogeography of this ant. High genetic divergence and population structure were observed for the whole species. The current pattern of D. lucida diversity seems to be shaped during different geological times: middle Pliocene, early Pleistocene and mainly late Pleistocene, when the reduction of populations generated a structure pattern of the genetic variation of this species. Our data show that this structure results from the maintenance of populations of D. lucida within very small putative refuges to the south of the central Bahia refugium. We thus argue that, for some Atlantic forest endemic species, especially those resistant to very small fragments of forest, such as D. lucida, the small putative refuges were as important as, or even more important than, larger and stable refuges for the creation and maintenance of diversity, adding another piece to the puzzle of the mechanisms underlying local endemism.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is one of the most important and yet the most devastated Brazilian biome, occupying in the past the majority of the East Atlantic Coast. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the soils near the coastal line influenced by this biome is essential for land use and management of these environments. The aim of this study was to acquire a deeper knowledge of the chemistry, mineralogy and genesis of soils in two micro-watersheds of the Atlantic Forest Biome. Eight soil profiles were sampled and described along one transect. Both young and more developed soils exhibit low fertility and low Fe2O3 content. The Oxic Dystrudepts are less dystrophic than the other soils studied and exhibit greater availability of K+, due to the mixing of weathered material and primary minerals. Transitions from shallow to deep soils are more common in rejuvenated landscapes. All soils are kaolinitic (Kt), with low levels of goethite (Gt) and hematite (Hm), and contain secondary 2:1 minerals such as mica (Mi) and, in the youngest soils, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV) and interstratified mica-hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (MiHIV). The widespread presence of gibbsite (Gb) in soils, including the Lithic Udifolist, indicates high rates of both pedogenesis and morphogenesis. The gibbsite showed good crystallinity suggesting that climate, terrain and good drainage favored its formation and stability.},

Here, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of A. fasciculata based on plastid and nuclear markers, aiming to better understand the impact of Pleistocene climate changes on BAF vegetation. We used population genetics, demographic methods and ecological niche modelling coupled to an evolutionary approach to describe the species distribution across time. The phylogeographic analysis of A. fasciculata indicated that Pleistocene climate changes played an important role in its evolution. The species is structured in two groups of populations that emerged from different refugia and were under different climate influences, supporting previously proposed connections between the Atlantic and Amazon Forests, the two most important Neotropical rainforests.},

The model predicts that a large forested area in the north–central region of this biome has remained stable during the last glacial maximum, and only relicts in its current southernmost distributions. All available sequences for phylogeographical studies on vertebrates on the Atlantic forest were obtained from GenBank. All datasets consisted of mitochondrial sequences and were submitted to the same analyses, including time of divergence and migration rates between phylogeographical lineages, as well as historical demography analyses, including neutrality tests and Ne estimates. The species studied showed different degrees of phylogeographical structure. Two contact zones are defined: one very heterogeneous in south-east Brazil that was largely congruent with the CM model and one around the Doce river further north. Population genetics analyses showed a smaller effective number on southern population, and most of these southern populations showed evidence for recent demographic expansion. These features are also in agreement with the CM model. Additionally, divergence/expansion events dated back to the Pleistocene epoch in all but one organism. According to hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation analysis, most of the data can be attributed to a single event. The results highlight the need for more finescale studies in the Atlantic forest.},

Although inselbergs provide key ecosystem services, little is done for their conservation and, so far, a lot of their unknown evolutionary history has already been lost by human activities. Using a fine-scale approach, here we tested if habitat and environmental filtering (the inselberg’s harshness) affect the evolutionary diversity of an Atlantic Forest inselberg in Brazil. We recorded all trees with a diameter at breast height ≥ 5 cm in 20 plots in four habitat types (total sampled area of 0.8 hectares), from highest to lowest: island, hillside, foothill, and semideciduous forest (matrix). We also collected soil samples for chemical, textural and physical soil characterization. We fitted linear models to test the effects of soil and habitat on plot-level metrics of phylogenetic diversity and structure, lineage diversity, phylogenetic β-diversity, and evolutionary distinctiveness. We found that the upper inselberg habitats contain a distinct set of ancient, closely related, harsh-tolerant lineages, as well as a subset of lineages that persist under harsh conditions with a certain degree of water availability. The inferior inselberg habitats harbor higher lineage diversity than expected by chance. Soil strongly predicted evolutionary diversity. We concluded that soil depth, slope, nutrients and texture (environmental filtering) and habitat types and topography (habitat filtering) shape the evolutionary history contained in fine-scale inselberg habitats, which should encourage the conservation of these ancient ecosystems.},

In this chapter, we introduce the Atlantic Forest focusing on describing the evolution of knowledge, the geographical limits, and the current proposals of sectorization in ecological units. The knowledge of the Atlantic Forest can be explained by three successive phases: (1) the science of naturalists (the late eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century), where the flora and fauna were described by European travelers; (2) the rise of science in Brazil, characterized by the organization of Atlantic Forest biodiversity in collections (1890–1985); and (3) the contemporary era (1985–2020), characterized by the publication of 8226 studies focused on 4 main topics – biogeography and systematics, conservation and biodiversity, plant-animal interaction, and populations and community. The understanding of the distribution limits of the Atlantic Forest biome (11 different proposals), as well as sectorization (4 different proposals), has been the subject of several studies and legislations, which are presented and discussed. Additionally, we present terminologies usually used to designate the Atlantic Forest as a whole, as well as its sectors, to facilitate understanding in future studies. We conclude that understanding the Atlantic Forest remains a long and endless exercise, given its complexity, increased knowledge, and continuous threats.},

Containing fragile ecosystems and home to millions of inhabitants, mountains are also places of great value for tourism, cultural practices and endemic species. In this paper, we developed the first multitemporal land-use and land-cover assessment of mountain regions within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), the most endangered Brazilian tropical biome. The study used spatial thematic mapping for 1985, 2001, and 2018 to understand changes in landscape composition, patterns of change in patch metrics of natural vegetation cover, and correlations between human population and natural vegetation. Change detection techniques, landscape metrics and statistical tests (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis) were applied. We found that landscape composition did not change at significant levels over the 34 years (1985–2018), but that intense exchange between natural vegetation and agriculture creates a shifting mosaic steady-state. Additionally, natural vegetation loss was 13-fold lower within mountains than in other areas of the BAF biome, which indicates lower human-induced change in mountain regions. Urban and rural population (number of inhabitants) showed positive correlation with natural vegetation at municipality level indicating higher presence of population in municipalities with large extents of natural vegetation. Analysis demonstrated that the study region was under lower population pressure and urban growth compared to other areas and had kept large extents of natural vegetation within large patches, different to what is observed at biome level. However, telecoupling processes may result in indirect land changes in mountain regions of the BAF biome. Our results indicate that mountains play a key role in conserving the remnants of the BAF.},

These maps can be used by researchers and landscape managers to understand and predict how ecological processes (e.g., animal movement, disease transmission, gene flow, and fire behavior) are likely to manifest in geographic space. Omniscape.jl makes use of Julia’s native multi-threading, making it readily scalable and deployable to high performance compute nodes.

Next, it describes current methods of predicting connectivity from resistance surfaces. It concludes with discussion of how effectively to validate connectivity model predictions. In recent years least-cost (LC) modelling has become the dominant modelling tool to evaluate functional landscape connectivity, especially in applied studies. Advances in computing have allowed applications of graph algorithms to continuous landscapes instead of simple networks. Circuit and LC models represent two extremes in assumptions about movement and connectivity. A promising graph-theoretic approach to connectivity modelling is centrality analysis.},

As interest grows in more dynamic representations of movement potential, modelers are often limited by the capacity of their analytic tools to handle these datasets. Technology developments in software and high-performance computing are rapidly emerging in many fields, but uptake within conservation may lag, as our tools or our choice of computing language can constrain our ability to keep pace. We recently updated Circuitscape, a widely used connectivity analysis tool developed by Brad McRae and Viral Shah, by implementing it in Julia, a high-performance computing language. In this initial re-code (Circuitscape 5.0) and later updates, we improved computational efficiency and parallelism, achieving major speed improvements, and enabling assessments across larger extents or with higher resolution data. Here, we reflect on the benefits to conservation of strengthening collaborations with computer scientists, and extract examples from a collection of 572 Circuitscape applications to illustrate how through a decade of repeated investment in the software, applications have been many, varied, and increasingly dynamic. Beyond empowering continued innovations in dynamic connectivity, we expect that faster run times will play an important role in facilitating co-production of connectivity assessments with stakeholders, increasing the likelihood that connectivity science will be incorporated in land use decisions.},

	abstract = {As both plant and animal species shift their ranges in response to a changing climate, maintaining connectivity between present habitat and suitable habitat in the future will become increasingly important to ensure lasting protection for biodiversity. Because the temporal period commensurate with planning for mid-century change is multi-generational for most species, connectivity designed to facilitate climate adaptation requires pathways with ‘stepping-stones’ between current and future habitat. These areas should have habitats suitable not only for dispersal, but for all aspects of species lifecycles. We integrated present-day land use, topographic diversity, and projections of shifting climate regimes into a single connectivity modeling approach to identify pathways for mid-century shifts in species ranges. Using Omniscape we identified climate linkages, or areas important for climate change-driven movement, as the areas with more current flow than would be expected in the absence of climate considerations. This approach identified connectivity potential between natural lands in the present climate and natural lands with future analogous climate following topo-climatically diverse routes. We then translated the model output into a strategic framework to improve interpretation and to facilitate a more direct connection with conservation action. Across modified landscapes, pathways important to climate-driven movement were highly coincident with the last remaining present-day linkages, reinforcing their importance. Across unfragmented lands, the presence of climate-adapted pathways helped inform the prioritization of conservation actions in areas where multiple connectivity options still exist. Many climate linkages follow major watercourses along elevational gradients, highlighting the importance of protecting or managing for these natural linear pathways that provide movement routes for climate adaptation. By integrating enduring landscape features with climate projections and present-day land uses, our approach reveals “no-regrets” pathways to plan for a connected landscape in an uncertain future.},

	abstract = {Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efﬁcient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene ﬂow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efﬁcient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},
